# GC-FinalProject
Final Project that can search for and recommend breweries based on user's mood
--

In order to pull the "Style" for our MVP, we plan to parse the a field in the API. This field is found within a beer entry. 
Among the fields in Beer is a list called "Style" among the fields in this is "Style" which will list something like "New England Lager". 
We will parse this string for one of several types of beer. This will be the style that we will use to
influence user recommendations.

Style names are:

North American Origin Ales
German Origin Ales
British Origin Ales
Belgian And French Origin Ales
Hybrid/mixed Beer
Mead, Cider, & Perry
North American Lager
Other Lager
European-germanic Lager
