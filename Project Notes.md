# GC-FinalProject
Final Project that can search for and recommend breweries based on user's mood
--

(Rough draft)
User will choose a mood and style and enter a location

Location is highest priority
Style is second priority
Mood is third priority

We will look at the breweries in the user's location
Of those  breweries we will look at the list of beers and find breweries with the style of beer the user is selecting
We will compare those beers to the stat associated with the user's mood. 
The top three beers that most closely matches this criteria will be listed along with the brewery on the results page.
