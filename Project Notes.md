# GC-FinalProject
Final Project that can search for and recommend breweries based on user's mood
--

In order to pull the "Style" for our MVP, we plan to parse the a field in the API. This field is found within a beer entry. 
Among the fields in Beer is a list called "Style" among the fields in this is "Style" which will list something like "New England Lager". 
We will parse this string for one of several types of beer - "lager", "ale", "stout" and others. This will be the style that we will use to
influence user recommendations.
